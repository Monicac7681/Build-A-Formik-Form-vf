# Build-A-Formik-Form-vf

<h2>Description of the project:</h2>

This project uses react and formik libraries to create a simple log in form. This web form has two fields and a submit button. I implmented the following input validation rules
- If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
- If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
- If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>

Currently, it only works on local server.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>

I plan to
- properly deploy this to Github. So it will run on web browser.
